## In this assignment i got question two wrong. For this question i chose the answer that four bits are not enough are not enough to store the eight directions. Five bits are are needed for the new veriosn of the game. Instead of choosing that four bits are nough to store the eight directions. The reason why i got this answer was because i didnt properly read the question and i didnt calculate the numbers but i just guessed,so next time i will make sure to take my time on each question and make sure to read it and also calculate properly.  
In this assignment i got question three wrong. The reason for this was because i thought of just adding two istead of doubling it. so when you double the two you get four times as much many IDs instead of two more unique IDs.
