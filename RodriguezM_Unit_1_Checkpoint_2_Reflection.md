Q2: Which of the following strategies can be implemented to achieve fault tolerance in a network?
The answer I chose for this question was use of open protocols to ensure standardization multple different bands, devices, internet services providers ect. I chose this answer because i didnt not review the topuc of fault tolerance and I wasn't sure which one tto choose so i choose this answer.
Q5: In network I, if device F is removed from the network, how many unique paths exist for data to travel between devices E and H without being routed through the same device more than one time?
